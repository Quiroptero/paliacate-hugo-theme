# 0.1.1 Change the landing page to a grid layout

The following non breaking changes were applied:
* The landing page `layouts/index.html` was changed to a responsive grid layout with thumbnails instead of larger pictures. CSS was adjusted for this.
* CSS style was updated with help of the one provided by Daniel Dickinson at https://github.com/danielfdickinson/image-handling-mod-hugo-dfd/blob/main/README-assets/sample.css

# 0.1.0 Initial implementation

First version of the theme.

It provides a simple way to get up and running my personal photography site.
